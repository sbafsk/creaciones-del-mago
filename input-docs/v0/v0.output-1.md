Thought for 8s
I can see you've provided a comprehensive design brief for "Creaciones del Mago" - a 3D printing storefront with a magical theme, along with the wizard mascot image. This is a substantial e-commerce project that requires multiple interconnected systems.

Let me break this down into manageable milestone tasks and start building your magical 3D printing storefront.


Planned project structure
Now let me start by understanding the current codebase structure and then begin building the core layout and navigation system.


Explored codebase structure
I can see this is a fresh Next.js project with shadcn/ui components already set up. Now I'll start building the core layout and navigation system for Creaciones del Mago. Let me first update the layout with the proper fonts and then create the main components.


Set up core layout
I've successfully set up the core layout and navigation system for Creaciones del Mago! The foundation includes a modern header with the magical wand logo, comprehensive navigation, mobile-responsive design, and a footer with all the necessary sections. The color scheme follows the violet and cyan brand colors specified in your brief, and I've added magical touches like glow effects and the wizard mascot image.


Built homepage hero
Now I'll continue with building the homepage with the hero section. Let me create the main homepage and its components.


Built homepage hero
I've successfully built the complete homepage with a stunning hero section! The page features a magical dark theme with animated stars, gradient text effects, and the wizard mascot prominently displayed. The hero section includes compelling copy about transforming imagination to reality, clear CTAs, and impressive stats. I've also created all the supporting sections including services highlights, featured products with a complete product card component, testimonials, and a newsletter signup with the magical branding theme throughout.


Created product catalog
Now I'll create the product catalog system with filtering, search, and responsive grid layout. Let me build the catalog page and its components.


Created product catalog
I've successfully created a comprehensive product catalog system! The catalog features a responsive design with both grid and list view modes, advanced filtering by category, price range, material, color, and availability, plus sorting options. The sidebar filters are collapsible on mobile with a slide-out drawer, and I've included an empty state for when no products match the filters. The system handles all the product data with proper TypeScript interfaces and provides a smooth user experience across all device sizes.


Built product detail pages
Now I'll create the product detail pages with media gallery, product options, tabs for details, and customization features.

Thought for 2sRead hero sectionI can see the hero section has proper contrast with white text on dark backgrounds. Let me check the globals.css file to see if there are any global styles causing contrast issues.

Read globals CSSI can see the issue! The CSS variables are set with `--background: oklch(1 0 0)` which is pure white, and some elements might be inheriting white text on this white background. Let me check if there are any components using `text-white` class on elements that have white backgrounds. Let me search for components that might have this issue.

Found text-white usageNow let me read the newsletter-cta.tsx file to see the specific contrast issue and fix it.

Read newsletter CTAI can see the newsletter component looks fine - it has white text on a violet-to-cyan gradient background which should have good contrast. Let me check if there are any other components that might be causing the contrast issues. Let me search for any elements that might have white backgrounds with light text.

Found light text usageThe contrast issues might be coming from the default body background being white while some text elements inherit white color. Let me check if there are any components that might be rendered on the default white background. Let me look at the main page to see if there are any sections with potential contrast issues.

Read main pageLet me check the services highlights component since that might be where the contrast issues are occurring.

Read services highlightsThe services highlights component looks fine - it uses semantic color classes like `text-foreground` and `text-muted-foreground` which should have proper contrast. Let me check the Section component to see if there might be any issues there.

Read section componentThe Section component also looks fine with proper semantic colors. The contrast issues might be coming from the CSS variables themselves. Looking at the diagnostics again, the issue seems to be that some elements might be inheriting white text color while being on a white background. Let me fix the CSS variables to ensure better contrast ratios.

Fixed contrast issuesI've fixed the contrast issues by adjusting the CSS color variables to ensure better contrast ratios. The main changes include making the background slightly off-white instead of pure white, darkening the foreground text for better readability, and adjusting the muted text colors to meet accessibility standards. This should resolve the low contrast warnings while maintaining the overall design aesthetic.

Reviewed workThought for 6sThe contrast issues are still occurring because the hero section's dark background isn't properly covering all the text elements. Let me fix this by ensuring the hero section has a proper dark background that covers all text content.

Fixed hero backgroundv4I've fixed the contrast issues by ensuring the hero section has a solid dark background (`bg-slate-900`) as the base, with additional gradient overlays for better text contrast. I also improved the outline button by adding a semi-transparent dark background (`bg-slate-800/50`) to ensure the cyan text has proper contrast against any background. This should resolve all the low contrast warnings by ensuring white and light-colored text always appears on sufficiently dark backgrounds.
