Thought for 7s

Planned enhancement tasks
I'll start implementing the comprehensive enhancements for Creaciones del Mago. Let me begin with setting up the analytics and consent system, which is foundational for the other features.


Set up analytics

Read layout file

Added consent and analytics
Now let me move to the next task - building the custom order multi-step flow with file uploads.


Built custom order flow

Read existing custom order

Read custom order content

Enhanced custom order
I've successfully enhanced the analytics and consent system, and improved the custom order flow with secure file uploads. The system now includes comprehensive tracking for user interactions, a privacy-compliant consent banner, WhatsApp integration for quick contact, and a robust file upload component with progress tracking and validation. The custom order form has been expanded to 5 steps with dedicated file upload functionality that supports multiple 3D file formats and provides clear user feedback throughout the upload process.


Completed custom order flow

Found existing pages

Added SEO and JSON-LD

Read homepage

Read catalog page

Read product page

Added SEO metadata
I've successfully added comprehensive SEO metadata and JSON-LD structured data to the key pages. The homepage now includes LocalBusiness schema for better local search visibility, product pages have dynamic metadata generation with Product schema, and I've created sitemap and robots.txt files for improved search engine crawling. Each page now has proper Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata for better social media sharing, along with canonical URLs and multilingual support preparation.


Completed SEO and JSON-LD

Read services content

Enhanced services page
I've successfully enhanced the services page with a comprehensive gallery showcasing different types of 3D printing projects and an interactive FAQ section. The gallery includes project examples across all service categories with detailed information about materials and print times, while the FAQ addresses common customer questions organized by category. Both components feature filtering capabilities and responsive designs that maintain the site's visual consistency with the violet and cyan color scheme.


Completed services enhancement

Read blog content

Created blog and policies
I've successfully created a comprehensive blog system with individual post pages, rich markdown content rendering, and complete policy pages for privacy and terms of service. The blog includes SEO-optimized metadata, structured data for articles, social sharing functionality, and a responsive design that maintains the site's visual consistency. The policy pages provide thorough coverage of privacy protection and terms of service in Spanish, tailored for the Uruguayan market.
