### What’s good
- Strong IA, clear pages, and solid e‑commerce scope.
- Good early thinking on SEO, trust, and the “Magic Box” differentiator.
- Useful design tokens and a concrete UI component inventory.

### How to make this better

- **Tie to outcomes**
  - Add numeric targets per funnel step: visits → product views → add‑to‑cart → purchase/quote; WhatsApp clicks; file uploads.
  - Define acceptance criteria for each page/flow (DOR/DOD) and a go‑live checklist.

- **User insight and flows**
  - Write 3 short personas + top tasks (JTBD) and map critical journeys: browse → buy; search → compare → buy; custom order with file upload; WhatsApp handoff.
  - Explicitly design edge cases: no stock, variant unavailable, large file upload, quote rejected, WhatsApp unavailable.

- **Accessibility and contrast (make it systematic)**
  - Lock a token‑based color system validated with APCA/WCAG 2.2 AA; document min contrast per component state.
  - Add an a11y pre‑flight: semantic landmarks, focus order, skip‑link, form labels/errors, keyboard traps, motion‑reduction.

- **Performance budgets**
  - Set budgets: LCP ≤ 2.5s, CLS ≤ 0.1, TBT ≤ 200ms on 4G/low‑end device.
  - Enforce with Lighthouse CI, bundle analyzer, image policies (WebP/AVIF sizes), and font strategy (local Inter, font‑display: swap).

- **Prompting and design system cohesion**
  - Version prompts/outputs; keep a single source of truth for tokens and component anatomy.
  - Add guardrails in prompts: brand voice, spacing scale, elevation, “never hard‑code colors—use tokens,” accessibility constraints.

- **Content and i18n**
  - Define copy standards: Spanish (voseo rioplatense), consistent casing, microcopy for states/errors.
  - i18n plan: Spanish default, English secondary; currency UYU with formatting; slugs per locale; hreflang and locale switcher.

- **E‑commerce for Uruguay (practicalities)**
  - Payments: prioritize Mercado Pago; plan for credit/debit + cash networks; consider installments.
  - Shipping/pickup: DAC/UES, delivery windows, pickup in Montevideo; live shipping tables or clear flat rates.
  - Tax invoice options and fan‑art/IP policy surfaced at checkout.

- **Custom order/file uploads (security + UX)**
  - Pre‑signed uploads to S3/GCS, 200MB limit, MIME validation, virus scan, progress bar, resumable uploads.
  - SLA messaging and status updates; quote acceptance/approval states.

- **SEO implementation details**
  - Canonicals, sitemaps (pages, products, blog), robots, Open Graph per type, JSON‑LD for Product/Offer/Review/LocalBusiness.
  - Internal linking from blog → categories/products; faceted navigation rules to avoid crawl traps.

- **Analytics and privacy**
  - Event spec: view_item, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, purchase, generate_lead, file_upload, whatsapp_click.
  - GA4 + Plausible dual setup, consent banner, server‑side events where possible, UTM hygiene.

- **Engineering plan**
  - Next.js App Router, ISR for products/blog, edge caching; state with Zustand; form handling with React Hook Form + Zod.
  - CMS choice and models (Sanity/Strapi/Contentlayer). Define product schema and content workflows.
  - Error and observability: Sentry, uptime, form failure alerts.

- **Testing and QA**
  - Unit (components), integration (filters/cart), e2e (Playwright for checkout/quote), visual regression (chromatic/percy).
  - Axe automated a11y tests in CI and manual screen reader pass.

- **Documentation governance**
  - Consolidate into `README.md → docs/ → standards/` with update‑first edits, avoid duplicates, and justify any new files [[memory:8035529]].
  - Add ADRs for key decisions (payments, CMS, hosting, color tokens).

- **Roadmap with phases**
  - Phase 1 (MVP): Catalog, Custom Order with file upload + WhatsApp, basic SEO/analytics, policy pages.
  - Phase 2: Checkout/payments, subscriptions, reviews, 3D viewer, search.
  - Attach timeboxes and demo/acceptance criteria to each.

### Optional: improved system prompt skeleton for UI generation
```markdown
System
- Brand: Creaciones del Mago. Voice: friendly, clever, whimsical but professional.
- Use tokens only (no raw hex): color, spacing, radii, shadows.
- Enforce WCAG 2.2 AA via APCA; no text under contrast threshold.
- Layout: 12‑col, container 1200px, mobile‑first; avoid layout shifts.
- Performance budgets: LCP ≤ 2.5s, CLS ≤ 0.1, TBT ≤ 200ms.

Developer
- Stack: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Lucide.
- Components must be accessible (labels, focus, keyboard).
- Copy: Spanish (voseo), concise CTAs.
- Output only React/TSX using provided tokens; never hard‑code styles.
```

### High‑impact quick wins
- Lock tokens + APCA‑validated themes and wire them into Tailwind.
- Write the analytics event spec and wire core conversions.
- Define file upload architecture (pre‑signed, validated) for Custom Order.
- Add Lighthouse CI, axe, and Sentry to CI/CD.
- Publish policy pages and consent banner before launch.

- I focused on making your plan execution‑ready: concrete KPIs, tested flows, tokenized accessibility, Uruguay‑specific commerce, secure uploads, analytics, and CI quality gates, all inside your existing documentation hierarchy.
