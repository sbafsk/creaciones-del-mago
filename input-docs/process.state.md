Quick take
Looks strong: consent + analytics, 5‑step Custom Order with uploads, SEO/JSON‑LD, Services gallery + FAQ, Blog + Policies.
The agent timed out while “Added i18n and accessibility”, so those are likely partial.
Gaps to close before next run
i18n scaffolding: locale switcher, locale‑aware routes/slugs, hreflang, UYU formatting, Spanish (voseo) defaults.
A11y pre‑flight: skip‑link, landmarks, focus order, keyboard traps, form error summaries, reduced‑motion. Re‑verify APCA contrast on all button states.
Consent gating: ensure no analytics fire pre‑consent, category toggles, persisted choice, first‑visit behavior.
Analytics wiring: central event util; verify payload shape; fire generate_lead, file_upload, whatsapp_click; add minimal tests.
Uruguay commerce: add Shipping + Returns pages (Footer), Mercado Pago stubs (incl. installments copy), DAC/UES options + Montevideo pickup, surface fan‑art/IP and invoice options near checkout/custom order.
Performance guardrails: code‑split carousel/gallery, responsive image sizes, font strategy (swap), Lighthouse CI budgets (LCP/CLS/TBT).
Minimal delta prompt for the next v0 run

Continue from current code. Do not rebuild existing components.

Implement:
1) i18n: locale switcher, locale-aware slugs, hreflang, UYU formatting, Spanish (voseo) default.
2) A11y pre-flight: skip-link, landmarks, focus order, form error summaries, reduced-motion; re-check APCA contrast for all button states.
3) Consent gating: block analytics until consent; category toggles; persist choice; first-visit display only.
4) Analytics: central util; wire view_item, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, purchase (stub), generate_lead, file_upload, whatsapp_click with payload {id,name,price,currency,category}.
5) Uruguay commerce: add /policies/shipping and /policies/returns; Mercado Pago UI stubs (incl. installments copy); DAC/UES options + Montevideo pickup info; surface fan-art/IP and invoice options near checkout/custom order.
6) Performance: code-split carousel/gallery; responsive images; font-display: swap; add Lighthouse CI config for LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, TBT ≤200ms.

Acceptance:
- i18n routing + hreflang present; Spanish UI copy follows voseo.
- Consent prevents analytics pre-consent; choices persist.
- Events fire with correct payloads; basic tests included.
- Policies linked in Footer; commerce stubs visible.
- Lighthouse CI config and budgets added; no contrast regressions.
