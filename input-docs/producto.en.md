Perfect! You have a very interesting business idea with a lot of creative potential ✨🔮. I’m putting together a comprehensive proposal for your Creaciones del Mago website, thinking through structure, content, SEO, and digital marketing so you can attract more clients in Montevideo and Uruguay (and eventually internationally).

🧩 Recommended structure for your website
1. Home
Hero banner with your slogan:
“Problem solving, 3D Printing, CAD Drawing, Toys and Anime Products”

Primary calls to action (CTA): “Explore the catalog” and “Request a custom design.”

Highlight your 3 main services with eye-catching icons:
- Custom 3D prints
- Character creation and 3D designs
- Tailor‑made solutions for students and businesses

Carousel with featured product photos.


2. Product Catalog (E‑commerce)
Organize into SEO‑friendly categories:
- Camping & Outdoor
- Kitchen & Home
- Decor & Gifts
- Toys & Collectible Figures
- Cannabis Accessories
- Anime, Geek & Pop Culture

Each product should include:
- High‑quality photos (white background and in‑context/use)
- SEO‑optimized description
- Price
- “Buy now” or “Add to cart” button
- Custom order option


3. Services
A clear page for your services:
- Custom character and figurine creation
  “Become your own hero, or gift a one‑of‑a‑kind figure.”
- 3D logo and branding design
- Student services (models, prototypes, technical parts)
  CTA: “Upload your file or ask for a design.”
- Specific problem solving
  “Do you have an idea or a problem at home or work? We create the solution from scratch with 3D printing.”


4. About
Tell your story:
- Who you are (the “Magician” behind the creations)
- Your passion for design and 3D printing
- Your vision: creativity, accessibility, and personalization
This builds emotional connection and trust.


5. Blog (very important for SEO)
Publish articles such as:
- “5 original gift ideas with 3D printing in Uruguay”
- “How 3D printing helps architecture and engineering students”
- “From imagination to reality: how we design your custom figurines”
- “The most useful camping accessories printed in 3D”
A blog with one post per month significantly improves your visibility on Google.


6. Contact
- Contact form
- WhatsApp Business with a direct button
- Address in Montevideo (if you offer local delivery or pickup)
- Email


📈 SEO and digital marketing strategy
Local keywords (for Google Uruguay):
- 3D printing Montevideo
- buy 3D figures Uruguay
- anime accessories Montevideo
- 3D printing for students Uruguay
- custom CAD design Montevideo
- personalized souvenirs Uruguay

Social networks connected to the website:
- Instagram (ideal to showcase products and short process videos)
- TikTok (creative videos of the “Magician” showing how something is printed)
- Facebook Marketplace (to capture local clients)

Trust strategy:
- Client reviews (testimonials on the website)
- Photos comparing the digital model vs. physical result

Extra marketing:
- Monthly newsletter with updates
- Seasonal promos: Children’s Day, Christmas, back to school (models)


🚀 Extra idea to differentiate yourself
Offer a “Magician’s Magic Box” service:
A monthly subscription where customers receive a surprise 3D‑printed object (geek, anime, or home accessory). This generates recurring revenue and builds loyalty.

Would you like me to prepare a visual draft of the website design (wireframe/mockup style), or would you prefer that I prepare SEO‑optimized text for each section right away?
