# Documentation Review Cycle Command

> Rationale: A repeatable review cycle ensures docs stay accurate and accessible.

## When to Use
- Before releases
- After major documentation changes

## Step-by-Step
1. Technical Accuracy: validate commands, code snippets, and configs
2. Content Quality: clarity, grammar, tone, and completeness
3. UX Review: navigation, headings, scannability, and search
4. Maintenance: ensure SSOT, remove duplicates, add cross-references

## Example Invocation
- "/review-cycle: run a full review and summarize findings"

## Output
Generate `docs/_working/review-report-[date].md` with findings and action items.
